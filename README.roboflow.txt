==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on December 26, 2021 at 3:44 PM GMT

It includes 124 images.
Faces are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 420x420 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
